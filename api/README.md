What is an API?
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs enable the integration of different systems, allowing them to work together and share data seamlessly.


What is a REST API?
A REST API, or Representational State Transfer API, is a type of API that adheres to a set of architectural principles. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. REST APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and stateless, making them a popular choice for web-based applications and services.

What are Microservices?
Microservices is an architectural style for designing complex software applications as a collection of small, independent services. Each service is focused on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices architecture promotes flexibility, scalability, and maintainability, allowing for easier management of large and evolving systems.

PEP8 Python Style Guide
PEP8 is a style guide for writing Python code. It outlines conventions for formatting code, naming variables, and structuring programs. Adhering to PEP8 ensures that your code is clean, readable, and consistent, making it easier for other developers (including future-you!) to understand and maintain the codebase. Following industry-standard style guides like PEP8 is highly valued in the software development industry.
